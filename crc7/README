crc7 project -- scripts to install fedora 19 on acer c7 chromebook


installation steps:

[1] boot into developer mode. switch to console 2 with ctrl-alt-f2. 
    login as chronos user.

[2] download "hd-repartition.sh". run by "bash hd-repartition.sh" 
    to repartition the hard drive. it shall shrink the /dev/sda1 stateful 
    partition to make space for fedora kernel on /dev/sda6 and the rootfs 
    on /dev/sda7 partition. if it detects sda1, sda6, sda7 are contineous 
    it shall re-arrange the partitions to the new size you choose.

[3] reboot. hit control-d as usual. it shall show at the center of screen: 
    "Your system is repairing itself. Please wait". and it shows at the 
    top line of the screen an ETA of 5:00:00 counting down for 5 minutes. 

[4] at the end it reboots again. hit control-d as usual to drop into 
    developer mode. login as chronos. verify the new partition with 
    "cgpt show /dev/sda". 

[5] download "download-fc19data.sh". run by "bash download-fc19data.sh". 
    it shall download the rootfs data segment files into "data" directory. 
    when done it shall combine them into one .tgz file for installation use. 

[6] download "hd-install.sh". run by "bash hd-install.sh". it shall 
    install fc19 with the following actions: 

      copy the current chromeos kernel 3.4 image from sda2 or sda4, 
      repackage it, and transfer it to sda6 for fedora use. 

      create an ext4 filesystem on sda7. extract the downloaded fc19 
      rootfs from the tgz file into the new filesystem on sda7. 

      modify partition table to enable booting kernel from sda6 with 
      rootfs at sda7 the next time. 

[7] when done it reboots into fedora 19. typical things to do in fedora: 

      Change root password. it is set to root temporary by default.
      Change user password. it is set to user temporary by default.
